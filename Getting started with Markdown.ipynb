    "# Markdown for Jupyter notebooks\n",
    "\n",
    "Markdown is intended to be as easy-to-read and easy-to-write as is feasible.Markdown’s syntax is comprised entirely of punctuation characters, which have been carefully chosen so as to look like what they mean. Markdown’s syntax is intended for one purpose: to be used as a format for writing for the web.\n",
    "\n",
    "Markdown is not a replacement for HTML, or even close to it. Its syntax is very small, corresponding only to a very small subset of HTML tags. The idea is not to create a syntax that makes it easier to insert HTML tags. In my opinion, HTML tags are already easy to insert. The idea for Markdown is to make it easy to read, write, and edit prose. HTML is a publishing format; Markdown is a writing format. Thus, Markdown’s formatting syntax only addresses issues that can be conveyed in plain text.\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Headings:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Markdown supports two styles of headers, `Setext` and `atx`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Setext-style headers are \"underlined\" using equal signs (for first-level headers) and dashes (for second-level headers). Any greater than one number of underlining ='s or -'s will work.\n",
    "\n",
    "Atx-style headers use 1-6 hash characters at the start of the line, corresponding to header levels 1-6.<br>\n",
    "Use the hash (<span style=\"color:green\">#</span>) symbol followed by a blank space:<br>\n",
    "<span style=\"color:green\">#</span> for titles<br>\n",
    "<span style=\"color:green\">##</span> for major headings<br>\n",
    "<span style=\"color:green\">###</span> for subheadings<br>\n",
    "<span style=\"color:green\">####</span> for any 4th level subheadings<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "## Monospace font:\n",
    "Surround text with a back single quotation mark ( \\` ), also known as a backtick or a grave.\n",
    "## **Emphasis:**\n",
    "Bold: `__abcd__` or `**abcd**`<br>\n",
    "Italic: `_abcd_` or `*abcd*`\n",
    "\n",
    "## Line breaks:\n",
    "### Hard breaks:\n",
    "Put a blank line after the line\n",
    "### Soft breaks:\n",
    "Append two spaces or the `<br>` tag\n",
    "\n",
    "## Colors:\n",
    "`<font color=blue>SampleText</font>` gives <font color=blue>SampleText</font><br>\n",
    "`<font color=red>SampleText</font>` gives <font color=red>SampleText</font><br>\n",
    "`<font color=green>SampleText</font>` gives <font color=green>SampleText</font><br>\n",
    "`<font color=pink>SampleText</font>` gives <font color=pink>SampleText</font><br>\n",
    "`<font color=yellow>SampleText</font>` gives <font color=yellow>SampleText</font>\n",
    "\n",
    "## Indents\n",
    "### Blockquotes:\n",
    "Use `>` symbol with a space.\n",
    "\n",
    "For eg:-\n",
    "\n",
    "`> This is a blockquote with two paragraphs. Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet,\n",
    "consectetuer adipiscing elit. Aliquam hendrerit mi posuere lectus.\n",
    "Vestibulum enim wisi, viverra nec, fringilla in, laoreet vitae, risus.`\n",
    "\n",
    "Blockquotes can be nested (i.e. a blockquote-in-a-blockquote) by adding additional levels of `>`. It can also contain other Markdown elements, including headers, lists, and code blocks.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Codeblocks:\n",
    "Pre-formatted code blocks are used for writing about programming or markup source code.<br>\n",
    "To produce a code block in Markdown, simply separate every block by a blank line and indent the block by at least 4 spaces or 1 tab.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a normal paragraph:\n",
    "\n",
    "    This is a code block.\n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "## Lists\n",
    "Markdown supports unordered (bulleted) and ordered (numbered) lists.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Bullets:\n",
    "Use `-` or `+` or `*`symbol with a space.\n",
    "For sub-bullets use a tab and then the `-` or `*`symbol with a space\n",
    "\n",
    "### Numbered lists:\n",
    "Start each line with some number and a period, then a space. The actual number is irrelevant. It is only there to indicate that the line should be considered as an ordered list item. Unordered list items are converted to numbered list items if they are at the same indentation level.\n",
    "\n",
    "It’s worth noting that it’s possible to trigger an ordered list by accident, by writing something like this:<br>\n",
    "`1986. What a great season.`<br>\n",
    "To avoid this, backslash-escape the period:<br>\n",
    "`1986\\. What a great season.`\n",
    "\n",
    "## Colored boxes\n",
    "Use the `div class` tags:\n",
    "\n",
    "For eg:-<br>\n",
    "`<div class=\"alert alert-block alert-info\">Tip: Use blue boxes for Tips and notes. If it’s a note, you don’t have to include the word “Note”.` will produce <div class=\"alert alert-block alert-info\">Tip: Use blue boxes for Tips and notes.</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-block alert-warning\">Example: Use yellow boxes for examples that are not inside code cells, or use for mathematical formulas if needed.</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-block alert-success\">Up to you: Use green boxes sparingly, and only for some specific purpose that the other boxes can't cover. For example, if you have a lot of related content to link to, maybe you decide to use green boxes for related links from each section of a notebook. </div>\n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-block alert-danger\">Just don't: In general, just avoid the red boxes.</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "## Links\n",
    "There are two different link types in Markdown, but both of them render the exact same way.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Inline Links\n",
    "1. Write the display text in brackets `[ ]`<br>\n",
    "2. Wrap the link in parenthesis `( )`<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "For eg:-\n",
    "`[Visit GitHub!](www.github.com)` produces [Visit GitHub!](www.github.com)\n",
    "\n",
    "Display text can incorporate emphasis and can be within a header too!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Reference Links\n",
    "Here, the link is actually a reference to another place in the document.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Here's [a link to something else][another place].\n",
    "    Here's [yet another link][another-link].\n",
    "    And now back to [the first link][another place].\n",
    "\n",
    "    [another place]: www.github.com\n",
    "    [another-link]: www.google.com\n",
    "    \n",
    "An advantage of the reference link style is that multiple links to the same place only need to be updated once.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Images\n",
    "The syntax is nearly the same as that of Links. The difference between links and images is that images are prefaced with an exclamation point ( ! ).\n",
    "### Inline Image link\n",
    "1. Enter an exclamation point ( ! )\n",
    "2. Optionally, write the alt text in brackets `[ ]`<br>\n",
    "3. Wrap the link in parenthesis `( )`<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "### Reference Image link\n",
    "\n",
    "Similiar to Reference Links, just precede with ( ! ) and the the optional alt text and finally the link itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "    ![The first father][First Father]\n",
    "    ![The second first father][Second Father]\n",
    "    [First Father]: http://octodex.github.com/images/founding-father.jpg\n",
    "    [Second Father]: http://octodex.github.com/images/foundingfather_v2.png"
